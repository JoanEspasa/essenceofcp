As our first example, imagine that you are emigrating to a new country. The
airline you will be using limits the total weight of your luggage to 50kg.
To make sure you do not forget anything, you made a list of all the items that
you will need.  Sadly their total weight surpasses the allowed limit, so you
will need to decide which elements you leave behind.

In this scenario the smart thing to do is to use all the available weight. So you
start by making a list of the elements and their weight to figure out what is the
best combination.

\begin{figure}
\begin{lstlisting}
language ESSENCE' 1.0
letting weights=[10, 30, 25, 12, 5, 15, 28]
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{List of all weights, in Essence Prime}
\label{fig-knapsack1param}
\end{figure}

Now that we have recorded the weights of all the elements we want carry with us,
we can model the problem very easily with Essence Prime.

\begin{figure}
\begin{lstlisting}
language ESSENCE' 1.0
letting weight_limit be 50

given weights : matrix indexed by [int(0..objects)] of int(1..)
find choosen : matrix indexed by [int(0..objects)] of bool

such that
(sum i : int(0..objects) . choosen[i] * weights[i]) = weight_limit
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{Model in Essence Prime to decide what to bring with us.}
\label{fig-knapsack1}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\item put line numbers in the figures
\item explain all the parts of the models
\item introduce problem/param concept with the example that maybe your partner also 
wants to bring a limited set of objects
\item explain intuitively how the solver approaches the solution of the problem
\item show how to execute SR and get a solution
\item consider the full knapsack problem by considering the monetary value of each object
and maximizing the cost of everything we select while respecting the weigth limit
\end{itemize}
